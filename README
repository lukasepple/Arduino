Arduino
=======
simply all my Arduino sketches.

building
--------
I use ino <http://inotool.org/> with my Arduino. Therefore the folder structure doesn't work with the default Arduino IDE (but the IDE is able to fix it).
Also I use the Arduino Ethernet, so you may configure your ino for that board.

friting
-------
I added some files for fritzing <http://fritzing.org/download/>.
